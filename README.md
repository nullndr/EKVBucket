# Key - Value Store in Elixir

This is an [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) application that works as a distributed key-value store.

> ⚠️ This is just a little application for me to learn Elixir.

### Development

In order to compile the code, run `mix compile`.

Once the code has been compiled inside the `_build` folder, run
`iex -S mix` trying out the changes from an `iex` session.

### Testing

Mix comes with a testing framework called [ElixirUnit](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html#elixirunit).

Run `mix test` to run the tests.
